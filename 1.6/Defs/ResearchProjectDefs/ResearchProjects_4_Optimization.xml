        <discoveredLetterTitle>About: Core Assistants</discoveredLetterTitle>
        <discoveredLetterText>Core Assistants are powerful implants that can be installed into any non-biomimetic synstruct to enhance their capabilities. Create them at a parts workbench, and install them using repair stims. Due to limited space in the core, each synstruct may have exactly one core assistant at a time. This enhancement will be lost if the pawn dies due to their core being destroyed.</discoveredLetterText>

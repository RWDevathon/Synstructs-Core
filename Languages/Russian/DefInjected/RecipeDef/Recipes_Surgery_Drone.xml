  <ABF_Recipe_Synstruct_ReprogramDrone.description>A straightforward but delicate operation on foreign drones, taking command of one to suit the colony's purposes is an excellent way to strengthen capabilities. However, the previous owners may have installed safeguards against such operations, so there is a high risk of death should it fail.\n\nOn colony drones, it is a completely harmless but rather time consuming operation that can reprogram appropriate drones to reallocate its work capacities, skills, and directives.</ABF_Recipe_Synstruct_ReprogramDrone.description>

  <ABF_Recipe_Synstruct_RemoveProgramming.description>A straightforward operation for cleanly wiping out all directives and programming from a drone, leaving it completely blank and in stand-by.</ABF_Recipe_Synstruct_RemoveProgramming.description>

  <ABF_Recipe_Synstruct_InstallExtraHardware.description>More hardware does not always mean more computational power, but additional memory and hardware can enhance the maximum complexity of a drone at the cost of power and coherence efficiency.</ABF_Recipe_Synstruct_InstallExtraHardware.description>

  <ABF_Recipe_Synstruct_RemoveExtraHardware.description>Sometimes exceeding a unit's physical standard specifications is no longer required. Drones, luckily, do not complain when it comes time to remove that which makes them more advanced. They do, however, need to restart to adjust to the lost capacity.</ABF_Recipe_Synstruct_RemoveExtraHardware.description>

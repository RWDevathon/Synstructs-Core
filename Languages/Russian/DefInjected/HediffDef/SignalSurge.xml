  <ABF_Hediff_Synstruct_SignalSurge.description>A synthetic solution containing a wide range of highly conductive and signal-boosting compounds is surging through the sensor and control networks of the chassis, greatly improving information flow. Until it wears off, the unit will benefit from a minor consciousness boost.</ABF_Hediff_Synstruct_SignalSurge.description>

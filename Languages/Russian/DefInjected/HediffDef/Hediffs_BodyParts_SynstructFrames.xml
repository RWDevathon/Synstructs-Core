  <ABF_Hediff_Synstruct_Frame_Refined.description>A  frame exquisitely and precisely etched, carved, and designed to look as refined and eminently noble as possible.

  <ABF_Hediff_Synstruct_Frame_Sanitary.description>A frame ruthlessly treated and sanitized to ensure zero habitability to microscopic biological entities.

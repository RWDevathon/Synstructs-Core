  <ABF_Thing_Synstruct_StasisPill.description>A small pill containing a slurry of highly conductive, mildly sedative synthetic chemicals. Synstructs can absorb the chemicals into their system, greatly reducing power consumption at the cost of reduced work efficiency.\n\nDesigned for long-distance travel without access to reliable power, this pill will reduce power consumption by 75% at a 50% work speed penalty. Commonly used by raiders, traders, and soldiers who value efficiency and who don't engage in labor.</ABF_Thing_Synstruct_StasisPill.description>
